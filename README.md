# Capsule GAN

[Link to the paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15g9VFyGwjPnGcTzjXEDwvGpfNvPuRXqB/view?usp=sharing)

Code for my Master thesis on "Capsule Layer as a Discriminator in Generative Adversarial Networks". In order to reproduce results, follow the "capsule_gan" Jupyter notebook that contains:
* Dataset loading and preprocessing
* Both Discriminator and Generator structures
* Training, loss functions
* Image outputs
* Metrics visualization

But first you may want to install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and corresponding dependencies from environment.yml:
`conda env create -f environment.yml` within the project directory as well as install [required tools for GPU computing](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#requirements_to_run_tensorflow_with_gpu_support). If no GPU is going to be used - delete the `tensorflow-gpu` line from environment.yml.

Thanks to @eriklindernoren (<https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN>) who I borrowed the Keras implementation of DCGAN from and @XifengGuo (<https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras>) who I took the squashing function from.
